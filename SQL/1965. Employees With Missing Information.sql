-- Table: Employees

-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | employee_id | int     |
-- | name        | varchar |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- employee_id is the primary key for this table.
-- Each row of this table indicates the name of the employee whose ID is employee_id.
 

-- Table: Salaries

-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | employee_id | int     |
-- | salary      | int     |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- employee_id is the primary key for this table.
-- Each row of this table indicates the salary of the employee whose ID is employee_id.
 

-- Write an SQL query to report the IDs of all the employees with missing information. The information of an employee is missing if:

-- The employee's name is missing, or
-- The employee's salary is missing.
-- Return the result table ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

-- The query result format is in the following example.

 

-- Example 1:

-- Input: 
-- Employees table:
-- +-------------+----------+
-- | employee_id | name     |
-- +-------------+----------+
-- | 2           | Crew     |
-- | 4           | Haven    |
-- | 5           | Kristian |
-- +-------------+----------+
-- Salaries table:
-- +-------------+--------+
-- | employee_id | salary |
-- +-------------+--------+
-- | 5           | 76071  |
-- | 1           | 22517  |
-- | 4           | 63539  |
-- +-------------+--------+
-- Output: 
-- +-------------+
-- | employee_id |
-- +-------------+
-- | 1           |
-- | 2           |
-- +-------------+
-- Explanation: 
-- Employees 1, 2, 4, and 5 are working at this company.
-- The name of employee 1 is missing.
-- The salary of employee 2 is missing.

-- OUTER JOIN
-- There is no natively implemented Outer Join in MySQL.
-- But we can implement OUTER JOIN in MySQL by taking a LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN union.
-- If column names of two tables are identical, we can use the USING clause instead of the ON clause.
